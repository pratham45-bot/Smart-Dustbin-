# 🗑️ Smart Dustbin – IoT Based Waste Management System

## 📌 Introduction
The **Smart Dustbin** is an IoT-based embedded systems project designed to improve waste management through automation and sensor-based monitoring. The system enables automatic lid operation and garbage level detection, reducing human contact and preventing dustbin overflow.

This project demonstrates the practical use of **embedded systems, sensors, and IoT concepts**, making it suitable for smart city and hygiene-focused applications.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Automate waste disposal using sensors  
- Reduce human contact with garbage  
- Monitor garbage fill levels efficiently  
- Apply embedded systems concepts to a real-world problem  

---

## ⚙️ System Overview
The system uses an **ultrasonic sensor** to detect a person approaching the dustbin and to measure the garbage fill level. Based on the sensor data, a **microcontroller** controls a **servo motor** to automatically open and close the lid.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Automatic lid opening and closing  
- Contactless and hygienic operation  
- Garbage level detection  
- Low-cost and energy-efficient design  
- Easy to implement and scalable  

---

## 🛠️ Hardware Components
- Microcontroller (Arduino / ESP32)  
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)  
- Servo Motor  
- Power Supply  
- Jumper Wires  

---

## 💻 Software & Tools
- Arduino IDE  
- Embedded C / C++  
- Serial Monitor (for debugging)  

---

## 🔁 Working Principle
1. The ultrasonic sensor continuously measures distance.  
2. When a person is detected near the dustbin, the lid opens automatically.  
3. The sensor monitors the garbage level inside the dustbin.  
4. After a short delay, the lid closes automatically.
